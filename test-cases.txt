In playground, here are what the files test:

* a is a normal file
* b (1) is present twice with the same name
* c is present twice with different names
* d is alone with a name to shorten
* e is present a lot of times
* f is present twice with different names and different content ('f.txt' and 'f (1).txt' are different files)
